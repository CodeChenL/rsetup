# rsetup config file
# Configurations here will be applied on every boot.
#
# Additionally you can create `before.txt` and `after.txt` in this folder.
# They will run before and after this file and will be deleted in the end.
# This makes them suitable for one-time setup.
#
# Example can be found in the default `before.txt`:
